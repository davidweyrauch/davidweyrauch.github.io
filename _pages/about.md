I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Graduate School of Social Science at the University (GESS)](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de/) at the University of Mannheim  and a teaching and research associate at the Chair of Political Science II - European Politics. I teach quanitative methods as well as undergrad courses on international cooperation. I am interested in the political conflict of coalition governments and hwo this conflict may impact different elements of international cooperation. I am further working on a project on transnational governance with [Thomas Winzen](https://thomaswinzen.com/). My research has been published among others in the [Review of International Organizations](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-021-09413-5) and [Global Policy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1758-5899.12873)
