I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Graduate School of Social Science at the University (GESS) at the University of Mannheim  and a teaching and research associate at the Chair of Political Science II - European Politics. I teach quanitative methods as well as undergrad courses on international cooperation. I am interested in the political conflict of coalition governments and hwo this conflict may impact different elements of international cooperation. I am further working on a project on transnational governance with [Thomas Winzen](https://thomaswinzen.com/).
