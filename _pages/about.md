I am a PhD candidate at the [Graduate School of Social Science (GESS)](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de/) at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/) and a teaching and research associate at the Chair of Political Science II - European Politics. I teach quanitative methods as well as undergrad courses on international cooperation. I am interested in the impact of coalition conflict on different elements of international cooperation. Additionally, I am working on a project on transnational governance with [Thomas Winzen](https://thomaswinzen.com/). My research has been published among others in the [Review of International Organizations](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-021-09413-5) and [Global Policy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1758-5899.12873)
