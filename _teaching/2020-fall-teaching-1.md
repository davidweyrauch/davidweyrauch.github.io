The goal of this class is to introduce the varying forms and causes of international cooperation. By focussing on theories of cooperation, students will be able to critically assess cooperative arrangements. By introducing empirical research on different types of cooperation students will familiarize themselves with the broad range of cooperative arrangements and by focusing on case-studies of specific agreements and arenas students are repeatedly exposed to a key method of scholarship about international relations.
