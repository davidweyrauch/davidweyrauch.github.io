# ECPR 2021
## The effect of Chinese government policy on transnational internet standard-setting

### Introduction

The Chinese governments' attempt to influence internet governance is well-documented (DeNardis, 2014; Galloway &amp; He, 2014; Harcourt et al., 2020; Mueller, 2010; Shen, 2016; Weiss &amp; Wallace, 2021; Weyrauch &amp; Winzen, 2020).

--

  - China has advocated greater .strong-highlight[intergovernmental control], e.g. via the International Telecommunication Union (Carr, 2015; Galloway &amp; He, 2014; Glen, 2014; Nocetti, 2015; Take, 2012).

--

  - Key conflict between China and the United States over the design of internet standard setting. 

&lt;!---
  -  The debate also often focused on ICANN

    - a relatively narrow arena, with an important but highly specialized mandate (Becker, 2019; Galloway &amp; He, 2014; Koppell, 2005; Negro, 2020; Take, 2012).
---&gt;

--

  - Standard setting takes place in .strong-highlight[transnational arenas and networks] (SDOs) (Bygrave &amp; Bing, 2009; DeNardis, 2009; Musiani et al., 2016), such as:
      - Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
      - World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
      - IEEE

???

IEEE: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
--

Against this backdrop, we try to answer two questions: 
1. How do .strong-highlight[governmental policies] affect the participation of Chinese actors in SDOs 
2. How did these actors .strong-highlight[integrate] into the transnational system of international SDOs

---
### Explanations of participation in Internet Standard-Setting


- Historical .strong-highlight[latecomer disadvantages] might persistently depress Chinese participation irrespective of governmental goals (Büthe &amp; Mattli, 2011; Stephen, 2014).

--

- Participation may be driven by the rapid .strong-highlight[growth] of the Chinese .strong-highlight[economy] and the emergence of powerful global companies.


--

Yet, both views have problems:


- The former disregards that Chinese actors increasingly participate in internet SDOs (Contreras, 2014; Nanni, 2021; Weyrauch &amp; Winzen, 2020). 

- The latter downplays the dependence of the economy on the state in China and autocratic states generally (Andonova et al., 2017; Stephen, 2014; Weiss &amp; Wallace, 2021).


???

- government policy might not matter for private actors’ SDO participation at all.

  - The (economic) rise of China would have a strong effect on SDOs but Chinese .strong-highlight[government policy] in a narrow sense would not.
  

---
### How do we explain *participation* in transnational standard-setting? 


Government policy can .strong-highlight[constrain] private actors’ involvement in transnational arenas, even if these actors have incentives and capacities to participate. 

--

  - If constraints cease due to a new government policy that is compatible with transnational participation, participation should increase.
  
  - We expect especially private actors to engage, as economic incentives from participation are greatest for this group.

--

### How do we expect Chinese actors to *integrate* in transnational standard-setting? 

--

- Due to their different relationship with the state, actors from autocracies may find it difficult to insert themselves into historically grown networks of US and European actors (Stephen, 2014, Weiss and Wallace, 2021, p. 640).



--

We expect Chinese actors to integrate relatively seamlessly into the collaborative standard-setting process.
  
1. the .strong-highlight[low political salience] of internet SDOs
2. the .strong-highlight[limited centrality] of their work for the survival of the Chinese regime 
3. the .strong-highlight[heterogeneity] of the domestic policy environment (Weiss &amp; Wallace, 2021)
4. China’s interest in the .strong-highlight[functioning] of the internet on a technical level

???
-  China and the US, have tense relations in internet governance at an intergovernmental level (Carr, 2015; Galloway &amp; He, 2014; Glen, 2014; Nocetti, 2015; Take, 2012).


- China participated in internet governance primarily through state-owned research institutions and state agencies. This reflected the wider state of the technology industry in the country that had focused on production over high technology development and
innovation, including new standards (see also Xia, 2017)
  
  
- and de Graaff (2020) also finds that corporate elites integrate into Western corporate networks in parallel.

- WTO accession restricted some protectionist measure

- IETF: privately-run, US-centered, highly technical, and collaborative

- It might thus be the case that deeper economic and institutional incompatibility might undermine any potential effect of Chinese government policy on the participation of Chinese actors in these arenas.

### Generalized synthetic controls

We compare the development of Chinese stakeholder participation to participation from other states. 



--

 
- The goal of the generalized synthetic control model is to .strong-highlight[predict the outcome] for China in the .strong-highlight[absence of the treatment] and compare this predicted counterfactual to the .strong-highlight[observed number of participants]. 

  - We treat the policy change that occurred around the year 2002 as the .strong-highlight[treatment] in a .strong-highlight[generalized synthetic control] model (Abadie et al., 2010, 2015; Xu, 2017)

 
   
- In more substantive terms, we try to predict how many Chinese participants we would expect in the IETF if we had not observed a new policy by the Chinese government and compare this estimate the actual, observed value.

--

- The counterfactual case is constructed by assessing the behavior of a set of control cases.

  - We focused on countries that were mostly absent from the IETF before 1990
   
  - Our control group consists of a set of 15 states and includes, for example, India, Israel, or Australia. 
   
- We control for Polity scores, GDP per capita, and include country and year FEs

???

- The difference between the .strong-highlight[estimated number of participants] in absence of a treatment and the .strong-highlight[observed number of participants] is the estimated .strong-highlight[average treatment effect on the treated] (Xu, 2017).


---
### The treatment 

Broad consensus that around the year **.strong-highlight[2002]** a considerable shift in policy of the Chinese government has taken place. 

--

1. Hu Jintao  became General Secretary of the Communist Party in 2002 and president in 2003

--

2. The government sought to reduce dependence on foreign technology innovation and standards. 

--

- This policy included greater reliance on the major companies that had emerged in a process of industry restructuring (Xia, 2017).
  
- This was also necessitated by WTO accession in 2001, which required rewriting the national standards strategy (Suttmeier, 2005).
  
  - Following 2002, the government initiated a series of new plans and policy documents to enhance technology and standards leadership in domestic and global governance (Liu, 2012, pp. 48–50).

    - This policy change was not limited to internet governance and internet SDOs but strongly affected this domain.



???

One of Hu Jintao's goals has been the development of native technologies without the reliance on foreign partners

### The Internet Engineering Task Force


.pull-left[



- Key SDO arena 

  - Develops .strong-highlight[technical standards] focused on the packaging, addressing, transfer, and reception of information
  - Output is publicly available via .strong-highlight[RFCs]
  - Participation by engineers from major technology companies, academics, actors from the so-called “technical community” , civil society, and governments.
  
- Decision making in the IETF is technical and consensual

  - Yet, companies might have different standardization preferences, leading to standard-setting competition (Harcourt et al., 2020; Simcoe, 2012).

Based on RFC-authorship we collected
- 8.323 RFCs
- 5.455 authors
- 2.204 distinct organization names 
- Grouped into 1.736 major organizations (e.g. "Google" and "Google Inc.")


- We define the country origin of RFC authors based on the location of the headquarters of their organizations. 

- Our data spans almost 5 decades (1969-2018)

Based on the RFC-coauthorships we created annual cooperative networks

&lt;br&gt;

- Authorship is often a collective project

&lt;br&gt;

- Authors often publish more than one RFC
    - Therefore authors often connect different authors across projects

Number of .strong-highlight[ties] of participants from different regions

- Chinese engineers cooperate most often with other Chinese engineers

  - So do European and US engineers

- Chinese engineers are not isolated but frequently co-author RFCs with engineers from the US and Europe

- The total number of ties is still smaller than for US and European engineers

- Degree (top): Average number of ties of actors from different by region

  - European and US average degree scores have developed "in parallel"
  - Chinese engineers have overtaken actors from the EU and US in 2011

- Betweenness (bottom): Average number of actors connected by region

  - Potentially driven by strong outliers (individuals that connect large parts of the network)
  - However, development similar for all three groups
]

---
### Conclusion

Change in Chinese policy leads to an increase of participation in the IETF by Chinese engineers

  - Though there is a considerable implementation phase
  
  
&lt;br&gt;

Participation is driven by engineers from private companies

  - However, engineers from academia and the technical community also engage more frequently

&lt;br&gt;
  
Chinese engineers have integrated into the existing network of IETF co-authorship rather than work in parallel

  - Though all groups (China, US, EU) cooperate most often with engineers from their region, there is no distinctive gap observable when it comes to cooperation across regions.

### Who participates?

- The goods deliberated in internet governance can be considered to be club goods.

  - These are non-rivalrous but excludable, which means that accession to the club can have additional benefits for certain stakeholders.

- Private actors (compared to, for example, academics) have an additional incentive to engage in cooperation at the transnational level. 
  - Benefit by adhering to shifting governmental policies - avoiding potential costs of non-compliance.
  - Benefit by shaping standards that they have to implement at a later stage - avoiding adaptation costs.

- We expect the change in participation to be driven by private actors
